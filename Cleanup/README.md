# Order of files to be executed

## 1. Download and clean main dataset from CDC -- Raw_Cleanup.ipynb
	
Either keep the code as it is to do all the work for you, or switch the URL in the first cell to a relative path to the raw dataset on your machine

## 2. Download and clean the hospital capacity data -- Hospital_Data.ipynb

This code should run quickly without any issue

## 3. Merge the two -- Capacity_Merge.ipynb

You should not have to do anything besides change the URL in the first cell of step # 1. Besides that, you should only have to hit "run" 3 times.
